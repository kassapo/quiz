# Guessing game

One out of a group of players is given a random term to present to the others.
The others may attempt to guess the term within two minutes.
Repeat.

  * The first screen asks the group to pick one of their members.
Everybody else should not look at the screen.

  * The second screen presents the term.

  * The third screen has the timer counting down.
The counting can be interrupted if the term has been guessed.
The game will return to the first screen.

  * The fourth screen appears when the count down runs out.
From it you can return to the first screen.

The game does not keep score. All it does is pick a term.
